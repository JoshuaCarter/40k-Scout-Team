# Warhammer 40k Vanguard

This is a personal project to re-imagine ***Warhammer 40k Kill Team*** according to what I believe to be the proper objectives.

## Design Goals

#### Be an alternative way to play 40k for experienced players:

- Quicker games.
- Easier to transport.
- Simple to learn.

#### Be an effective gateway into 40k for new players:

- Use the normal 40k rules as the foundation, and make minimal alterations. This means that the time and money a player invests into **Vanguard** effectively carries over into regular 40k. It also means we can make full use of the many fun rules found in the 40k codex books.

- Support very small games that can generally be played using a single box of infantry. This keeps the required time/money investment low for new players.

- Support flexible army composition, even in very small games. New models should mean new opportunities.

- Allow the game size to scale up alongside a player's growing collection of models. This game should only start getting "too big and slow" around the time that switching to regular games of 40k becomes viable.
