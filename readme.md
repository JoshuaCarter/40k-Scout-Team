# Warhammer 40k Scout Team

This is a personal project to re-imagine ***Warhammer 40k Kill Team*** according to what I believe to be the proper objectives.

- [Core Rules](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/40k-Scout-Team/blob/main/core-rules.md)
- [Core Rules FAQ](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/40k-Scout-Team/blob/main/faq.md)

## Design Goals

To be an effective gateway into 40k for new players:

- Use the normal 40k rules as the foundation, and make minimal alterations. This means that the time and money a player invests into *Scout Team* effectively carries over into 40k. It also means we can make full use of the many fun and flavorful rules found in the 40k codex books.

- Support very small games that can generally be played using a single box of infantry. This keeps the required time/money investment low for new players.

- Support flexible army composition, even in very small games. New models should mean new opportunities.

- Allow the game size to scale up alongside a player's growing collection of models. This game should only start getting "too big and slow" around the time that switching to regular games of 40k becomes viable.

To serve as alternative way to play 40k for experienced players:

- Quicker games that are easier to squeeze into a busy schedule.
- Fewer models to transport.
- Very quick to learn for existing 40k players.
