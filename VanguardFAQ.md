# Vanguard FAQ

#### ***I found a rule that doesn't work in Vanguard, what should I do?***

Let us know by [rasing an issue](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/issues/new) (the more info the better).

Check the [Faction Rules](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/tree/main/VanguardFactionRules) to see if there's a proscribed solution for you rule. Otherwise you should discuss your situation with your opponent until you both agree on a solution.

#### ***Can I use a BattleField Size of 22"x30" (like Kill Team)?***

Yes, provided your opponent agrees.

---

#### ***Is there a minimum/maximum points limit?***

No, this is intentionally undefined. While Vanguard plays best with a points limit of 100-300, any size that works for you and your opponent is fine.
