# Vanguard FAQ

#### ***I found a rule that doesn't work in Vanguard, what should I do?***

First, let us know by [rasing an issue](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/issues/new) (the more info the better).

You may find that some faction specific rules (***Abilities***, ***Relics***, ***Strategems***, etc) are nullified or meaningless in the absence of multi-model units. You can check the faction rules to see if there is a proscribed solution for your specific rule, but if there isn't, then for the purpose of resolving your rule, try using some combination of the following suggestions:

- Treat all models in your army as a single unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the relevant ***Unit Name*** as a single unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the relevant ***Keyword*** as a single unit; **OR**
- Treat all models within *x* range of the relevant model as a single unit, where *x* is:
    - ***Engagement*** range (1"); **OR**
    - ***Coherency*** range (2"); **OR**
    - ***Consolidate*** range (3"); **OR**
    - ***Move*** range; **OR**
    - ***Ability*** range; **OR**
    - ***Strategem*** range; **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***visible*** models; **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***friendly*** or ***enemy*** models.

Generally this shouldn't be done for rules that still function as intended but only affect a single model. You should discuss your situation with your opponent until you both agree on a solution.

#### ***Can I use a BattleField Size of 22"x30" (like Kill Team)?***

Yes, provided your opponent agrees.

---

#### ***Is there a minimum/maximum points limit?***

No, this is intentionally undefined. While Vanguard plays best with a points limit of 100-300, any size that works for you and your opponent is fine.

---

#### ***How do you make wound rolls with Blast weapons when the target unit has multiple toughness values?***

Use the majority toughness value; in the case of a tie use the highest value.
