# 40k Vanguard FAQ

***What is the recommended game size?***

*200 points.*

> These rules aim to provide a good playing experience for games ranging in size from 50-400 points, but the "sweet-spot" is somewhere between 100-300 points. Games can start slowing down as they get bigger, so you may wish to consider switching to regular games of 40k when that becomes an issue.

***How is Blast Range measured?***

*From the edge of the initial target's base, to the edge of any other model's base or hull. The same is true for the *Split Fire* rule.*

> This means that a 2" *Blast Range* usually results in a blast diameter of ~5". You may optionally use an old-hammer "large blast template" as a replacement for these measurements.

***How does cover work with Blast weapons?***

*Cover is calculated for the initial target in same manner as normal ranged attacks. For other models impacted by the blast, cover is calculated as though the attack has be fired by the initial target. This means that only the terrain between the initial target, and the other models impacted, will be relevant to determining what cover those other models receive.*

***How do you allocate attacks "evenly" for Blast weapons?***

*You must allocate a single attack to all target models before allocating a second attack to any target model; then a second attack to all target models before a third attack to any target model; and so on.*
