# 40k Vanguard Rules

Vanguard is played according to the normal 40k core rules unless stated otherwise.

Text in **bold** refers to an official term from the 40k core book (see [**references**](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/blob/main/VanguardRules.md#references)).

## Building An Army

All games are played using a **points limit**.

### Detachments

All **Detachments** include the following rules:

- This detachment can be **Battle Forged** even if it contains **Understrength** units.
- Your **Warlord** is always considered to be a **Character** with the **HQ** **Battlefield Role**.
- Units in this detachment may ignore all minimum unit size requirements for **Wargear Options**.
- Required slots can be filled by an **Understrength** unit, provided it costs at least 1/4 of the **points limit**.

> This enables players to bring a variety of units and wargear, even for very small games. It also makes room for specialist armies such as the White Scars.

---

## Missions

### Deploy Forces

At the start of deployment, before any units have been set up, you may split up units in your army into smaller units of any size.

> This enables models to be deployed and act individually or in smaller groups, without forcefully splitting up units that would suffer from doing so.

## The Battle Round

### Shooting Phase

#### Selecting Targets

When selecting a target for a ranged weapon, you may instead choose an enemy model (excluding **Characters**, **Vehicles**, and **Monsters**), and target any number of enemy units within 2" (excluding **Characters**, **Vehicles**, and **Monsters**), allocating attacks as evenly as possible to each, and resolving attacks against each unit individually. **Blast** weapons use the total number of models targeted to determine the number of attacks.

> This keeps multi-attack weapons relevant when used against clusters of enemy models.

#### Look Out, Sir

Friendly units are only required to contain at least 2 models.

> This keep the rule functional even after breaking units up into smaller units.

---

### Morale Phase

#### Morale Tests

Treat all units in your army with the same **Unit Name** as though they are a single unit.

> This keep the rule functional even after breaking units up into smaller units.

#### Reanimation Protocols

Reanimation Protocols *always* activates when a model with this ability is destroyed.

Successful Reanimation Protocol rolls go into a dice pool that is shared between all models with the destroyed model's ***Unit Name***. This pool persists until the end of the phase.

Until the end of the phase, any time you add dice to a pool, you can immediately use the dice in that pool to reanimate destroyed models with the same ***Unit Name*** as that pool, provided they were destroyed during this phase.

At the end of each phase, all dice in all pools are discarded.

> Reanimation Protocol isn't easily translated for Vanguard, but this keeps the odds of reanimating fairly consistent with the normal rules. It would be a good idea to mark the location of destroyed units until the end of the phase.
