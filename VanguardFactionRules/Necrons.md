# Necron Rules

Here you will find rules alterations specific to Necrons.

### Abilities

#### Reanimation Protocols

Reanimation Protocols *always* activates when a model with this ability is destroyed.

Successful Reanimation Protocol rolls go into a dice pool which is dedicated to models with the destroyed model's ***Unit Name***. This pool persists until the end of the phase.

At the end of the phase you can use the dice in each pool to reanimate destroyed models of the dedicated ***Unit Name***, provided they were destroyed during this phase.

> Reanimation Protocol isn't easily translated for single-model units, but this keeps the odds of reanimating fairly consistent with the normal rules. It would be a good idea to mark the location of destroyed units until the end of the phase.
