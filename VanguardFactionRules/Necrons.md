# Necron Rules

Here you will find rules alterations specific to Necrons.

### Abilities

#### Reanimation Protocols

Reanimation Protocols *always* activates when a model with this ability is destroyed.

Successful Reanimation Protocol rolls go into a dice pool that is shared between all models with the destroyed model's ***Unit Name***. This pool persists until the end of the phase.

Until the end of the phase, any time you add dice to a pool, you can immediately use the dice in that pool to reanimate destroyed models with the same ***Unit Name*** as that pool, provided they were destroyed during this phase.

At the end of each phase, all dice in all pools are discarded.

> Reanimation Protocol isn't easily translated for single-model units, but this keeps the odds of reanimating fairly consistent with the normal rules. It would be a good idea to mark the location of destroyed units until the end of the phase.
