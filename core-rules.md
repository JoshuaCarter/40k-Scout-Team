# Scout Team Rules

## Reading Guide

- If a rule in this list contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter takes precedence.

- Text in ***Bold Italics*** refers to an official term from the core rules, and will often be paired with a page reference.

- Pay special attention to the difference between a ***Unit*** and a ***Model*** <sub>(p. 197)</sub>.

- > Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## Immutable Laws

- Scout Team is played according to the normal 40k rules for a game of ***Combat Patrol*** <sub>(p. 244)</sub> size, unless stated otherwise.

- Armies must calculate their cost in points.

- Armies must use the *Scout Detachment* (detailed below).

- The minimum ***Battlefield Size*** is 22" x 30".

> Even though the minimum *Battlefield Size* is now 22" x 30", it is recommended that you use the normal *Battlefield Size* of 44" x 30" for most games above 100 points.

## Scout Detachment

A Scout Detachment is identical to ***Patrol Detachment*** <sub>(p. 248)</sub>, with the following exceptions:

- This detachment is always considered ***Battle Forged*** <sub>(p. 244)</sub>.
- The ***HQ*** unit requirement only applies if playing with over 300 points.
- The ***TROOP*** unit requirement can be met with an ***Understrength Unit*** <sub>(p. 241)</sub> provided:
	- The unit's total cost is at least half your total points budget; **OR**
	- The unit's total cost is at least 100 points.
- All other units not part of this detachment's requirements may be an ***Understrength Unit*** without penalty.
- You can only include a single unit of any given ***Unit Name*** <sub>(p. 202)</sub>.

## Core Rules Alterations

The following is a list of changes to the 40k core rules.

### Single Model Units

- Once you have completed the ***Muster Armies*** <sub>(p. 236)</sub> mission step, all models are treated as separate units, each containing 1 model, with a ***Starting Strength*** <sub>(p. 201)</sub> of 1.

> This rule serves to allow models to act independently of one another. Wherever the core rules refers to a "unit", you can mentally substitute "model" (with some exceptions covered further below).

- All models are considered to be in ***Unit Coherency*** <sub>(p. 198)</sub> at all times.

### Shooting Phase

- When ***Selecting Targets*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> in the shooting phase, you are also able to allocate each weapon's individual attacks to multiple enemy models by following these steps:
    1. Select a model to shoot.
    1. Select a weapon from that model to fire.
    1. Select the initial target model for that weapon.
    1. Allocate the first attack from that weapon to the initial target.
    1. Allocate each remaining attack to:
        - The initial target; **OR**
        - Any other ***visible*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> enemy model within range, and within 3" of the initial target.
    1. Repeat above steps for all weapons.
    1. Resolve attacks.

> This rule prevents multi-attack weapons from being useless against hoards. It also helps to make each model's shooting a bit more interesting.

- When firing a ***Blast Weapon*** <sub>(p. 219)</sub>, follow these steps:
    1. Select a model to shoot.
    1. Select a ***Blast*** weapon from that model to fire.
    1. Select the initial target model for that weapon.
    1. Determine which other models are ***visible*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> to, and within 3" range of, the initial target.
        - If you control any of these models, you must select a different initial target.
        - If all of these models are enemies, treat these models as a single big unit for the purpose of resolving this weapon's attacks.
    1. Calculate the total number of attacks for this blast weapon.
    1. Resolve ***Hit Rolls*** (p. 220) simultaneously.
    1. Resolve ***Wound Rolls*** (p. 220) simultaneously.
        - When the target unit contains models with a mix of ***Toughness*** values, the majority ***T*** value is used; in the case of a tie,  use the higher value.
        - The player commanding the target unit still allocates wounds to models of their choosing.
    1. Resolve attacks.

> This rule prevents blast weapons from being useless against hoards. It also adds the interesting ability to attack targets that aren't *visible* to the shooter.

- When throwing a ***Grenade*** <sub>(p. 218)</sub>, follow the above steps for ***Blast Weapons***, but reduce the range to 2".

- Only one model in your army can throw a ***Grenade*** each shooting phase.

### Morale Phase

- For the duration of the ***Morale Phase*** <sub>(p. 232)</sub> treat all of your models on the battlefield as a single big unit.

> This means that each player will only ever perform a single ***Morale Check*** per ***Battle Round*** <sub>(p. 204)</sub>.

## The Big Unit Rule

You may find that some faction specific rules (***Abilities***, ***Relics***, ***Strategems***, etc) are nullified or meaningless within the context of the **Single Model Units** rule. You can check the faction rules to see if there is a proscribed solution for your specific rule, but if there isn't, then for purpose of resolving your rule, we suggest trying the following:

- Treat all models as a single big unit.
- Treat all models with the same ***Unit Name*** <sub>(p. 202)</sub> as as a single big unit.
- Treat all models that share the relevant ***Keyword*** <sub>(p. 203)</sub> as as a single big unit.
- Treat all models withing **X** range as a single big unit, where **X** is:
    - ***Engagement*** range (1").
    - ***Blast*** range (3").
    - Standard move range (6").

Don't apply the Big Unit Rule to core rules, or to rules that are simply less impactful due to only affecting a single-model unit rather than a multi-model unit.

> See the *Morale Phase* rules for an example of this rule being applied.
