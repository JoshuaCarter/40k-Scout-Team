# 40k Scout Team Rules

***Text in Bold-Italics*** refers to an official term or rule from the 40k core rules.

**Text in Bold** refers to a Scout Team specific term or rule.

*Text in Italics* is normal emphasis.

> Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## The Golden Rule

If any rule here contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter rule overrides the former.

## Immutable Laws

*Scout Team* is played according to the normal 40k core rules for a game size of ***Combat Patrol***, unless stated otherwise.

Armies must calculate their cost in points.

Armies must use the **Scout Detachment** detailed below.

The minimum ***Battlefield Size*** is 22" x 30".

> The smaller ***Battlefield Size*** is intended to cater for very small games or smaller playing spaces, but it is otherwise recommended that you use the normal ***Battlefield Size*** of 44" x 30".

## Scout Detachment

A **Scout Detachment** is identical to a ***Patrol Detachment***, with the following exceptions:

- This detachment is always considered ***Battle Forged***.
- The ***HQ*** unit requirement is ignored for games under 300 points.
- The ***TROOP*** unit requirement can be satisfied by a ***TROOP*** unit that:
    - Meets the normal requirements; **OR**
	- Is ***Understrength*** and costs at least 65 points; **OR**
    - Is ***Understrength*** and costs at least 1/3 of the total points cost for your army.
- Units that are not used to satisfy the minimum requirements of this detachment may be ***Understrength*** without penalty.

> This unique detachment allows players to bring an interesting variety of models in their armies, even for very small games. Requiring a few ***TROOP*** models keeps the game "feeling like 40k", and re-adding the ***HQ*** requirement in larger games helps slow the growing model count.

## Core Rules Alterations

The following rules override the 40k core rules.

---

### Mission Setup

#### Split Units

After you have completed the ***Muster Armies*** mission step, all units in your army are split up so that each model is now its own unit with a ***Starting Strength*** of 1.

All models are considered to be in ***Unit Coherency*** at all times, even when part of a **Combined Unit**.

> This allows models to act autonomously for the duration of the game. Wherever the core rules refers to a "unit", you can mentally substitute "model" (with some exceptions covered further below).

---

### Shooting Phase

#### Split Fire

When selecting a target for a ranged weapon with multiple attacks, you can choose to allocate those attacks to multiple enemies by following these steps:

1. Select the *initial target* model for this weapon.
1. Allocate the first attack to the *initial target*.
1. Allocate each remaining attack to:
    - The *initial target*; **OR**
    - Any other *enemy* model that is:
        - Within 3" of the *initial target*; **AND**
        - Within range of the shooter; **AND**
        - ***Visible*** to the shooter.

> This prevents multi-attack weapons from being useless against enemy hoards. It also helps to make each model's shooting a bit more interesting.

#### Explosive Fire

Weapons with the ***Blast*** ability have a **Blast Range** of:

- 1" if it is a ***Grenade***.
- 2" for all other ***Blast*** weapons.

When selecting a target for a ranged weapon with the ***Blast*** ability, follow these steps:

1. Select the *initial target* model for this weapon.
    - There must be no friendly models within **Blast Range** range of the *initial target*.
1. Form a **Combined Unit** of all enemies which are:
    - Within **Blast Range** of the *initial target*; **AND**
    - ***Visible*** to the *initial target*.
1. Calculate the total number of attacks against the **Combined Unit**.
1. Allocate the first attack to the *initial target* model.
1. Allocate the remaining attacks *evenly* to models in the **Combined Unit**, in an order of your choosing.

> This prevents blast weapons from being useless against enemy hoards. It also adds the interesting ability to attack targets that aren't ***visible*** to the shooter (by firing at a nearby model who is).

---

### Morale Phase

#### Team Spirit

For the duration of the ***Morale Phase*** treat all friendly models on the battlefield as a single **Combined Unit**.

> This means that at most, each player will roll a single ***Morale Check*** per ***Morale Phase***.

#### Heavy Losses

When rolling a ***Morale Check***, if your army is ***Below Half-strength***, you instead roll a D6 and add *twice* the number of models destroyed this turn.

> The skirmish nature of the game means that it's a bit too easy to pass ***Morale Checks***, even when your losses are significant.

## Combined Units

You may find that some faction specific rules (***Abilities***, ***Relics***, ***Strategems***, etc) are nullified or meaningless within the context of the **Split Units** rule. You can check the faction rules to see if there is a proscribed solution for your specific rule, but if there isn't, then for the purpose of resolving your rule, try using some combination of the following suggestions:

- Treat all models as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the relevant ***Unit Name*** as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the relevant ***Keyword*** as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models within *x* range of the relevant model as part of the same unit, where *x* is:
    - ***Engagement*** range (1"); **OR**
    - ***Coherency*** range (2"); **OR**
    - ***Consolidate*** range (3"); **OR**
    - ***Move*** range; **OR**
    - ***Aura*** range; **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***visible*** models; **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***friendly*** or ***enemy*** models.

Don't apply the **Combined Unit** rule to core rules, or to rules that still function as intended but only affect an single model due to the **Split Units** rule.

> By way of example, the **Combined Unit** rule is already applied to the ***Morale Phase*** rules and ***Blast Weapons*** rules.
>
> You should discuss this with your opponent until you both agree on a suitable approach for your specific rule.
