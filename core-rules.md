# 40k Scout Team Rules

## Rules Format

***Terms in Bold Italics*** refer to an official term from the 40k core rules, and will often be paired with a page reference.

*Terms in Italics* refer to an unofficial term and is used to highlight the relationship between rules.

> Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## The Golden Rule

If any rule here contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter rule overrides the former rule.

## Immutable Laws

Scout Team is played according to the normal 40k core rules for a game size of ***Combat Patrol*** <sub>(p. 244)</sub>, unless stated otherwise.

Armies must calculate their cost in points.

Armies must use the *Scout Detachment* detailed below.

The minimum ***Battlefield Size*** <sub>(p. 238)</sub> is 22" x 30".

> The smaller ***Battlefield Size*** is intended to cater for very small games or smaller playing spaces, but it is otherwise recommended that you use the normal ***Battlefield Size*** of 44" x 30".

## Scout Detachment

A *Scout Detachment* is identical to a ***Patrol Detachment*** <sub>(p. 248)</sub>, with the following exceptions:

- This detachment is always considered ***Battle Forged*** <sub>(p. 244)</sub>.
- The ***HQ*** unit requirement is:
    - Ignored for games under 300 points. **OR**
    - Satisfied by 1-2 ***HQ*** units with a combined cost of at least 50 points.
- The ***TROOP*** unit requirement can be satisfied by a ***TROOP*** unit that:
    - Meets the normal requirements; **OR**
	- Is ***Understrength*** <sub>(p. 241)</sub> and costs at least 65 points; **OR**
    - Is ***Understrength*** and costs at least 1/3 the total points cost of your army.
- Units that are not used to satisfy this detachment's minimum requirements may be ***Understrength*** without penalty.
- You may only include a single unit with any given ***Unit Name*** <sub>(p. 202)</sub>.

> This unique detachment allows players to bring an interesting variety of models in their armies, even for very small games. Requiring a few Troop models keeps the game "feeling like 40k", and re-adding the HQ requirement in larger games helps slow the growing model count. The ***Unit Name*** restriction is to prevent unit-leader stacking.

## Core Rules Alterations

The following rules override the 40k core rules.

---

### Mission Setup

#### Split Units

After you have completed the ***Muster Armies*** <sub>(p. 236)</sub> mission step, all units in your army are split up so that each model is now its own single-model unit with a ***Starting Strength*** <sub>(p. 201)</sub> of 1.

All models are considered to be in ***Unit Coherency*** <sub>(p. 198)</sub> at all times.

> This allows models to act autonomously for the duration of the game. Wherever the core rules refers to a "unit", you can mentally substitute "model" (with some exceptions covered further below).

---

### Shooting Phase

#### Split Fire

When ***Selecting Targets*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> in the shooting phase, you may optionally allocate each weapon's individual attacks to multiple ***enemy*** models by following these steps:

1. Select a model to shoot.
1. Select a weapon on that model to fire.
1. Select the *initial target* model for that weapon.
1. Allocate the first attack from that weapon to the *initial target*.
1. Allocate each remaining attack to:
    - The *initial target*; **OR**
    - Any other ***enemy*** model within range that is ***visible*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> to the shooter, and within 3" of the *initial target*.
1. Repeat above steps for all weapons on this model.
1. Resolve attacks normally.

> This prevents multi-attack weapons from being useless against hoards. It also helps to make each model's shooting a bit more interesting.

#### Blast Weapons

When firing a ***Blast Weapon*** <sub>(p. 219)</sub> it is considered to have a *Blast Range* of 2" and is resolved using the following steps:

1. Select a model to shoot.
1. Select a ***Blast Weapon*** on that model to fire.
1. Select the *initial target* model for that weapon.
1. Determine which other models are ***visible*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> to, and within *Blast Range* range of, the *initial target*.
    - If **any** of these models are ***friendly***, you must select a different *initial target*.
    - If **all** of these models are ***enemies***, treat these models as a single *Combined Unit* for the purpose of resolving the following steps.
1. Calculate the total number of attacks for this blast weapon.
1. Resolve attacks.
    - Resolve ***Hit Rolls*** (p. 220) simultaneously.
    - Resolve ***Wound Rolls*** (p. 220) simultaneously.
        - When the target unit contains models with a mix of ***Toughness*** values, the majority ***T*** value is used. In the case of a tie, use the highest tied value.
        - The player commanding the ***enemy*** unit allocates wounds to models of their choosing.

> This prevents blast weapons from being useless against hoards. It also adds the interesting ability to attack targets that aren't ***visible*** to the shooter (by firing at a nearby model who is).

#### Grenade Weapons

When firing a ***Grenade*** <sub>(p. 218)</sub> weapon it is considered to have a *Blast Range* of 1" and is resolved using the above steps for firing ***Blast Weapons***.

---

### Morale Phase

#### Team Spirit

For the duration of the ***Morale Phase*** <sub>(p. 232)</sub> treat all ***friendly*** models on the battlefield as a single *Combined Unit*.

> This means that at most, each player will roll a single ***Morale Check*** per ***Morale Phase***.

#### Heavy Losses

When rolling a ***Morale Check***, if your army is ***Below Half-strength*** <sub>(p. 201)</sub>, instead roll a D6 and add twice the number of models destroyed this turn.

> The skirmish nature of the game means that it's a bit too easy to pass ***Morale Checks***, even when your losses are significant.

## The Combined Unit Rule

You may find that some faction specific rules (***Abilities***, ***Relics***, ***Strategems***, etc) are nullified or meaningless within the context of the *Split Units* rule. You can check the faction rules to see if there is a proscribed solution for your specific rule, but if there isn't, then for purpose of resolving your rule, try the following:

- Treat all models as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the same ***Unit Name*** <sub>(p. 202)</sub> as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the same ***Keyword*** <sub>(p. 203)</sub> as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models withing **X** range of the relevant model as part of the same unit, where **X** is:
    - ***Engagement*** range (1"); **OR**
    - ***Grenade*** *Blast Range* (2"); **OR**
    - *Blast Range* (3"); **OR**
    - Standard move range (6"); **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***visible*** models.
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***friendly*** or ***enemy*** models.

Don't apply the *Combined Unit* rule to core rules, or to rules that still function as intended but only affect an *Independent Model* rather than a multi-model unit.

> By way of example, the *Combined Unit* rule is already applied to the *Morale Phase* rules and *Blast Weapons* rules.
>
> You should discuss this with your opponent until you both agree on a suitable approach for your specific rule.
