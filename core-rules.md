# 40k Scout Team Rules

## The Golden Rules

- If any rule here contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter rule overrides the former rule.

- ***Text in Bold Italics*** refer to an official term from the 40k core rules, and will often be paired with a page reference.

- *Text in Italics* refer to an unofficial term and is used to highlight the relationship between rules.

- Pay special attention to the difference between a ***Unit*** and a ***Model*** <sub>(p. 197)</sub>.

- > Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## Immutable Laws

- Scout Team is played according to the normal 40k core rules for a game size of ***Combat Patrol*** <sub>(p. 244)</sub>, unless stated otherwise.

- Armies must calculate their cost in points.

- Armies must use the *Scout Detachment* detailed below.

- The minimum ***Battlefield Size*** <sub>(p. 238)</sub> is 22" x 30".

> The smaller ***Battlefield Size*** is intended to cater for very small games or smaller gaming spaces, but it is recommended that you use the normal ***Battlefield Size*** of 44" x 30" for games above 100 points.

## Scout Detachment

A *Scout Detachment* is identical to a ***Patrol Detachment*** <sub>(p. 248)</sub>, with the following exceptions:

- This detachment is always considered ***Battle Forged*** <sub>(p. 244)</sub>.
- The ***HQ*** unit requirement only applies if playing a game over 300 points.
- The ***TROOP*** unit requirement can also be met with an ***Understrength Unit*** <sub>(p. 241)</sub> provided:
	- The unit's total cost is at least half the total points cost of your army; **OR**
	- The unit's total cost is at least 100 points.
- Units that are not part of this detachment's minimum requirements may be an ***Understrength Unit*** without penalty.
- You can only include a single unit of any given ***Unit Name*** <sub>(p. 202)</sub>.

> This detachment allows players to bring an interesting variety of models even in very small games, without allowing army composition to become too imbalanced, and the ***Unit Name*** restriction is to prevent squad leader stacking.

## Core Rules Alterations

The following rules override the 40k core rules.

---

### General

#### Independent Models

- After you have completed the ***Muster Armies*** <sub>(p. 236)</sub> mission step, all models are treated as separate units, each containing 1 model, with a ***Starting Strength*** <sub>(p. 201)</sub> of 1.

- All models are considered to be in ***Unit Coherency*** <sub>(p. 198)</sub> at all times.

> These rules serve to allow models to act autonomously. Wherever the core rules refers to a "unit", you can mentally substitute "model" (with some exceptions covered further below).

---

### Shooting Phase

#### Split Fire

- When ***Selecting Targets*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> in the shooting phase, you may allocate each weapon's individual attacks to multiple ***enemy*** models by following these steps:
    1. Select a model to shoot.
    1. Select a weapon on that model to fire.
    1. Select the *initial target* model for that weapon.
    1. Allocate the first attack from that weapon to the *initial target*.
    1. Allocate each remaining attack to:
        - The *initial target*; **OR**
        - Any other ***enemy*** model within range that is ***visible*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> to the shooter, and within 3" of the *initial target*.
    1. Repeat above steps for all weapons on this model.
    1. Resolve attacks normally.

> This rule prevents multi-attack weapons from being useless against hoards. It also helps to make each model's shooting a bit more interesting.

#### Blast Weapons

- ***Blast Weapons*** <sub>(p. 219)</sub> have a *Blast Range* of 3".
- When firing a ***Blast Weapon***, follow these steps:
    1. Select a model to shoot.
    1. Select a ***Blast Weapon*** on that model to fire.
    1. Select the *initial target* model for that weapon.
    1. Determine which other models are ***visible*** <sub>(p. 216)</sub> to, and within *Blast Range* range of, the *initial target*.
        - If **any** of these models are ***friendly***, you must select a different *initial target*.
        - If **all** of these models are ***enemies***, treat these models as a single *Big Unit* for the purpose of resolving the following steps.
    1. Calculate the total number of attacks for this blast weapon.
    1. Resolve attacks.
        1. Roll ***Hit Rolls*** (p. 220) simultaneously.
        1. Roll ***Wound Rolls*** (p. 220) simultaneously.
            - When the target unit contains models with a mix of ***Toughness*** values, the majority ***T*** value is used; in the case of a tie,  use the higher value.
            - The player commanding the ***enemy*** unit allocates wounds to models of their choosing.

> This rule prevents blast weapons from being useless against hoards. It also adds the interesting ability to attack targets that aren't ***visible*** to the shooter (by firing at a nearby model who is).

#### Grenade Weapons

- ***Grenade*** <sub>(p. 218)</sub> weapons have a *Blast Range* of 2".
- Resolve attacks with ***Grenade*** weapons using the above steps for firing ***Blast Weapons***.
- The number of ***friendly*** models who can use a ***Grenade*** weapon each shooting phase is determined by the game size.
    - 0-99 points = 1 model.
    - 100-199 points = 2 models.
    - 200-299 points = 3 models.
    - 300-399 points = 4 models.
    - 400-499 points = 5 models.

> The last point aims to keep grenades impactful as the size of your games scale up.

---

### Morale Phase

#### Team Morale

- For the duration of the ***Morale Phase*** <sub>(p. 232)</sub> treat all ***friendly*** models on the battlefield as a single *Big Unit*.

> This means that each player will only ever perform a single ***Morale Check*** per ***Battle Round*** <sub>(p. 204)</sub>.

## The Big Unit Rule

You may find that some faction specific rules (***Abilities***, ***Relics***, ***Strategems***, etc) are nullified or meaningless within the context of the *Independent Models* rule. You can check the faction rules to see if there is a proscribed solution for your specific rule, but if there isn't, then for purpose of resolving your rule, try the following:

- Treat all models as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the same ***Unit Name*** <sub>(p. 202)</sub> as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the same ***Keyword*** <sub>(p. 203)</sub> as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models withing **X** range of the relevant model as part of the same unit, where **X** is:
    - ***Engagement*** range (1"); **OR**
    - ***Grenade*** *Blast Range* (2"); **OR**
    - *Blast Range* (3"); **OR**
    - Standard move range (6"); **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***visible*** models.
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***friendly*** or ***enemy*** models.

Don't apply the *Big Unit* rule to core rules, or to rules that still function as intended but only affect an *Independent Model* rather than a multi-model unit.

> By way of example, the *Big Unit* rule is already applied to the *Morale Phase* rules and *Blast Weapons* rules.

> You should discuss this with your opponent until you both agree on a suitable approach for your specific rule.
