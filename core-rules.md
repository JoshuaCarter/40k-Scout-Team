# 40k Vanguard Rules

Text in ***Bold-Italics*** refers to an official term or rule from the 40k core rules. See [**Terms**](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/40k-Vanguard/blob/main/terms.md).
> Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## The Golden Rules

- If any rule here contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter rule overrides the former.
- Vanguard is played according to the normal 40k core rules unless stated otherwise.
- Armies must calculate their cost in points.

## Detachments

All detachments include the following rules:

- This detachment may be ***Battle Forged*** even if it contains ***Understrength***  units.
- Units can ignore the unit size requirements for ***Wargear Options***.
- The ***HQ*** unit requirement can be ignored for games under 300 points.
- You can treat all unit(s) for each required ***Battlefield Role*** as fulfilled, if at least 1/2 of your army's points have been spent on unit(s) with a matching ***Battlefield Role***.

> These additions keep army composition flexible and wargear options varied, even for very small games. Re-adding the ***HQ*** requirement in larger games helps slow the growing model count.

## Core Rules Alterations

### Mission Setup

#### Muster Armies

At the end of the ***Muster Armies*** mission step, split up all units in your army so that each model is now its own unit with a ***Starting Strength*** of 1.

> This allows models to act autonomously for the duration of the game. Wherever the core rules refers to a "unit", you can mentally substitute "model" (with some exceptions covered further below).

### Shooting Phase

#### Selecting Targets

When ***Selecting Targets*** for a ranged weapon *without* the ***Blast*** ability, if that weapon can make multiple attacks you can choose to allocate those attacks to multiple enemy models by following these steps:

1. Select the initial target model for this weapon.
1. Allocate the first attack to the initial target.
1. Allocate each remaining attack to the initial target, or to any other enemy model that is:
    - Within 3" of the initial target; **AND**
    - Within range of the shooter; **AND**
    - ***Visible*** to the shooter.

> This prevents multi-attack weapons from being useless against enemy hoards. It also helps to make each model's shooting a bit more interesting.

#### Blast Weapons

- Weapons with the ***Blast*** ability have a *Blast Range* of 2".
- ***Grenade*** weapons with the ***Blast*** ability have a *Blast Range* of 1".

When ***Selecting Targets*** for a ***Blast*** weapon, follow these steps:

1. Select the initial target model for this weapon. There must be no friendly models within *Blast Range* range of the initial target.
1. Determine which enemies are:
    - Within *Blast Range* of the initial target; **AND**
    - ***Visible*** to the initial target.
1. Treat these enemies as belonging to a single unit for the following steps.
1. Calculate the total number of attacks.
1. Allocate the first attack to the initial target model.
1. Allocate attacks to the other models in an order of your choosing, until all models have been allocated an attack.
1. Repeat steps 5-6 until all attacks are allocated.

> This prevents blast weapons from being useless against enemy hoards. It also adds the interesting ability to attack targets that aren't ***visible*** to the shooter (by firing at a nearby model who is).

#### Look Out, Sir

You cannot target a ***CHARACTER*** model, or allocated attacks from a ranged weapon without the ***Blast*** ability to a ***CHARACTER*** model, if that model is within 2" of any other enemy model that:
- Is ***Visible*** to the shooter; **AND**
- Is closer to the shooter; **AND**
- Has a base or hull size no more than 10mm smaller than that model's base (always use the largest possible measurement).

> This rule encourages players to spend points on strong ***CHARACTER*** models by retaining the ability to protect them, which is healthy in larger games, while also preventing small models from screening much larger models.

---

### Morale Phase

For the duration of the ***Morale Phase*** treat all friendly models on the battlefield as a belonging to a single unit.

> This means that at most, each player will roll a single ***Morale Check*** per ***Morale Phase***.

#### Morale Tests

When rolling a ***Morale Test***, if your army is ***Below Half-strength***, you instead roll a D6 and add *twice* the number of models destroyed this turn.

> The skirmish nature of the game means that it's a bit too easy to pass ***Morale Checks***, even when your losses are significant.
