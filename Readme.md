# Warhammer 40,000 - Vanguard

This project exists to offer an alternative way to play Warhammer 40k, by addressing two of it's most critical flaws - it can be big and slow, and it has a high barrier to entry for new player.

You might ask *"Isn't that what Kill Team is for?"* and you'd have a point, but Kill Team is diverging ever further from regular 40k and it leaves a void, one which Vanguard attempts to fill.

#### Design goals for new players:

- As much as possible, stick to the 40k core rules and codecies. This means that time and money invested into **Vanguard** also carries over into regular 40k.

- Don't add restrictions to what models and wargear a player can use; allow for an interesting variety, even in very small games. New models should mean new opportunities.

- Support very small games. This keeps the barrier to entry much lower than normal.

- Enable the game to scale up with a player's growing collection, until they are ready to play regular games of 40k.

#### Design goals for established players:

- Quick to learn.
- Quick to play.
- Easy to transport.

If Vanguard sounds like a game you'd like to play, see the [Vanguard Core Rules](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/blob/main/VanguardCoreRules.md), and feel free to provide feedback on the [Discussion Page](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/discussions).
