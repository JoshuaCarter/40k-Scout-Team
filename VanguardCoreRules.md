# 40k Vanguard Rules

Text in ***bold italics*** refers to an official term from the 40k core book (see [**references**](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/blob/main/VanguardCoreRules.md#references)).
> Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## The Golden Rules

- Vanguard is played according to the normal 40k core rules unless stated otherwise.
- If any rule here contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter rule overrides the former.
- All games are played using a ***points limit***.

## Building An Army

### Detachments

All ***Detachments*** include the following rules:

- This detachment can be ***Battle Forged*** even if it contains ***Understrength*** units.
- Units in this detachment may ignore all unit size requirements for ***Wargear Options***.
- This detachment has no more than 1 required slot per ***Battlefield Role***.
- This detachment has no required ***HQ*** slots if the ***points limit*** is under 300.
- Required slots can be filled by an ***Understrength*** unit that costs at least 1/4 of the ***points limit***.

> This enables players to bring a variety of units and wargear, even for very small games. It also makes room for specialist armies such as the White Scars.

---

## Missions

### Muster Armies

At the end of the ***Muster Armies*** mission step, you may break up any number of units in your army into smaller units of any size. All units start the game with a ***Starting Strength*** matching the number of models it contains.

> This enables models to be deployed and act individually, without forcefully splitting up units that would suffer from doing so, such as Grimaldus who's servitors can take wounds on his behalf.

---

## The Battle Round

### Shooting Phase

#### Selecting Targets

You may select additional targets for a ranged weapon provided all targets are within 2" of the initial target. Resolve attacks against selected targets separately.

***Blast*** weapons can only select an initial target that is not within 2" of a friendly model, and must select all additional targets within 2". Resolve attacks as though all selected targets belong to a single unit.

> This prevents multi-attack weapons from only being able to target a single model in most cases.

#### Look Out, Sir

Ignore the requirement for friendly units to contain 3+ models.

> This keep the rule functional even after breaking units up into smaller units of 1-2 models.

---

### Morale Phase

Starting with the player whose turn it is, players must perform the following steps:

1. Perform a ***Morale Test*** for each unit in your army and count the total number of failures. Models do not flee when failing this test.

1. For each failed ***Morale Test***, perform a ***Combat Attrition Test***, subtracting 1 from all results if your *army* is under ***Half-strength***. You decide which models from your *army* flee.

> This keeps morale functional and the odds of a model fleeing close to normal.
