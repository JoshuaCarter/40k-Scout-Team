# 40k Vanguard Rules

Text in ***bold italics*** refers to an official term from the 40k core book (see [**references**](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/blob/main/VanguardCoreRules.md#references)).
> Text in quote-blocks are designer notes.

## The Golden Rules

- Vanguard is played according to the normal 40k core rules unless stated otherwise.
- If any rule here contradicts an earlier rule, then the latter rule overrides the former.
- All games are played using a ***points limit***.

## Building An Army

### Detachments

All ***Detachments*** include the following rules:

- This detachment can be ***Battle Forged*** even if it contains ***Understrength*** units.
- Units in this detachment may ignore all unit size requirements for ***Wargear Options***.
- This detachment requires no more than 2 slot per ***Battlefield Role***.
- This detachment requires no ***HQ*** slots if the ***points limit*** is under 300.
- Required slots can be filled by an ***Understrength*** unit, provided it costs at least 1/4 of the ***points limit***.

> This enables players to bring a variety of units and wargear, even for very small games. It also makes room for specialist armies such as the White Scars.

---

## Missions

### Muster Armies

At the end of the ***Muster Armies*** mission step, you may break up any number of units in your army into smaller units of any size.

> This enables models to be deployed and act individually, without forcefully splitting up units that would suffer from doing so, such as Grimaldus who's servitors can take wounds on his behalf.

## The Battle Round

### Shooting Phase

#### Selecting Targets

After selecting a target unit for a weapon, you may select any number of additional targets within 2" of the initial target. You may allocate any number of attacks to each target. Resolve all attacks against a unit before proceeding to the next. To determine the number of attacks for a ***blast*** weapon, use the total number of *models* in all target units.

> This prevents multi-attack weapons from only being able to target a single model in most cases.

#### Look Out, Sir

Ignore the requirement for friendly units to contain 3+ models.

> This keep the rule functional even after breaking units up into smaller units of 1-2 models.

---

### Morale Phase

When performing ***Morale Tests*** and ***Combat Attrition Tests***, treat all ***Understrength*** units in your army with the same ***Unit Name*** as though they are a single unit.

> This keep the rule functional even after breaking units up into smaller units, without impacting units that didn't start the game understrength.
