# 40k Scout Team FAQ

***What is the recommended game size?***

*200 points.*

> These rules aim to provide a good playing experience for games ranging in size from 100 points to 300 points. Games can start slowing down as they get bigger, so you may wish to consider switching to regular games of 40k when that becomes an issue.

***How is Blast Range measured?***

*From the edge of the initial target's base, to the edge of any other model's base or hull*

> The same is true for the *Split Fire* rule.
