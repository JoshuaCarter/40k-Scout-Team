# Vanguard FAQ

#### ***I found a rule that doesn't work in Vanguard, what should I do?***

First, let us know by [rasing an issue](https://github.com/JoshuaCarter/Vanguard-40k/issues/new) (the more info the better).

You may find that some faction specific rules (***Abilities***, ***Relics***, ***Strategems***, etc) are nullified or meaningless within the context of the **Split Units** rule. You can check the faction rules to see if there is a proscribed solution for your specific rule, but if there isn't, then for the purpose of resolving your rule, try using some combination of the following suggestions:

- Treat all models as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the relevant ***Unit Name*** as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models with the relevant ***Keyword*** as part of the same unit; **OR**
- Treat all models within *x* range of the relevant model as part of the same unit, where *x* is:
    - ***Engagement*** range (1"); **OR**
    - ***Coherency*** range (2"); **OR**
    - ***Consolidate*** range (3"); **OR**
    - ***Move*** range; **OR**
    - ***Ability*** range; **OR**
    - ***Strategem*** range; **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***visible*** models; **OR**
- Any of the above but also restricted to ***friendly*** or ***enemy*** models.

Generally this shouldn't be done for rules that still function as intended but only affects a single model due to the **Split Units** rule.

You should discuss this with your opponent until you both agree on a suitable approach for your specific rule.

> By way of example, this approach has already applied to the ***Morale Phase*** rules and ***Blast Weapons*** rules.

#### ***What is the recommended game size?***

200 points.

> These rules aim to provide a good playing experience for games ranging in size from 50-400 points, but the "sweet-spot" is somewhere between 100-300 points. Games can start slowing down as they get bigger, so you may wish to consider switching to regular games of 40k when that becomes an issue.

#### ***How is Blast Range measured?***

From the edge of the initial target's base, to the edge of any other model's base or hull. The same is true for the *Split Fire* rule.

> This means that a 2" *Blast Range* usually results in a blast diameter of ~5". You may optionally use an old-hammer "large blast template" as a replacement for blast measurements.

#### ***How does cover work with Blast weapons?***

Cover is calculated for the initial target in the same manner as normal ranged attacks. For other models impacted by the blast, cover is calculated as though the attack has be fired by the initial target (the location of the blast). This means that only the terrain between the initial target and the other targets will be relevant to determining what cover those other targets receive.

#### ***How do you allocate attacks "evenly" for Blast weapons?***

You must allocate a single attack to all target models before allocating a second attack to any target model; then a second attack to all target models before a third attack to any target model; and so on.
